# Project name: Neflix clone

This project is made with React and Firebase.

## IMDB API

I used IMDB api for fetch the movie data. In the `requests.js`, there is information that needs to fetch IMDB api.

## 1. Home Page

Home page has navbar, banner and slider.

## 2. Netflix slider

I used netflix slider from npm, and it was not easy to use. I need to make new json file by using the information of the movie.
